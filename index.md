# I'm an Assistant Professor in the Organisations & Innovation Group at University College London, School of Management.

My research focuses on diversity topics, including stereotyping and discrimination, intergroup relations, 
and bias-reducing interventions aimed at increasing the
representation of - and improving opportunities for - women and minorities in leadership and STEM (Science,
Technology, Engineering, Math). She is also interested in when and how people
belonging to underrepresented stigmatized groups are more likely to support and
advocate for one another.
