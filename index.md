Clarissaâ€™s research focuses on stereotyping and discrimination, intergroup
relations, and bias-reducing interventions aimed at increasing the
representation of women and minorities in leadership and STEM (Science,
Technology, Engineering, Math). She is also interested in when and how people
belonging to underrepresented stigmatized groups are more likely to support and
advocate for one another.
