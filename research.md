In my research, I draw from social psychological theory around social
identity, intergroup relations, and stereotyping to gain a better
understanding of organizational behavior — both in processes and
outcomes — with the ultimate goal of reducing identity-based biases and
promoting diversity in organizational settings. My work addresses two
questions: (1) What motivates individuals to support and promote
diversity and inclusion in their organizations? and (2) How can diverse
organizations maintain and foster an inclusive workplace where
individuals with underrepresented and disadvantaged social identities
can succeed and thrive in their organizational roles?
